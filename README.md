# REPO Death Capture

Uses Steam's new Game Recording feature to capture your best deaths.

# Requirements

You **must** manually [enable](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/23B7-49AD-4A28-9590#6) **Record in Background** in the Steam client.

That's it, you're done.

## Recommendations

You should also turn on **Record Microphone** so that Steam can capture any hillarity that ensues.

**Automatic Gain Control** may be useful but can produce crackly audio depending on your setup. If you plan to use this to capture clips long term, I recommend jumping into a save solo and testing with AGC on/off.
